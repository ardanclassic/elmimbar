### **About El Mimbar Digital**

El Mimbar Digital is a comprehensive web platform designed to empower Masjid Management Boards (DKM) in publishing and managing their mosque's information effortlessly. In today's digital age, El Mimbar aims to bridge the gap between mosques and their jamaah (congregation) by providing a user-friendly and feature-rich online presence. From daily prayer schedules to announcements, donation information, and photo galleries, El Mimbar ensures that vital mosque information is always accessible.

This project is built as a multi-tenant SaaS (Software as a Service) application, allowing multiple mosques to manage their distinct online presences from a single, scalable codebase.
